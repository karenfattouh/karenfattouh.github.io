<strong>A Story about My Growing Up Years</strong>

I was born in Rhode Island Hospital at <address> 593 Eddy Street Providence, Rhode Island 02903. </address>  I went home with my parents to our two bedroom apartment that was <s> $100/mo. </s> now $900/mo on Lafayette Street in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.  I lived there until I was two years old. <br> We moved to a duplex up the street and then my younger sister was born. My sister is four and a half years younger than me. My sister and I used to play with our friends in the neighborhood.  My sister and I had bikes and rode them in the neighborhood. We also used to play on the swingset, in a small pool, and hopscotch. My sister and I used to play board games like parcheesi with our friends and I used to choose the <del>blue</del><ins>red</ins>! We had <em>a lot of fun</em> growing up in our neighborhood. During the summers my friends, my sister and I would also have barbeque hamburgers, hot dogs, corn on the cob, and salad that my father loved to cook outside using his BBQ grill. My father, mother, sister and I used to have a picnic in our yard and invite my neighborhood friends. <br> When my brother was born we moved to a three bedroom tutor brick house in Oak Hill Platt.  All of us went to the local elementary public school. In middle school my sister and I went to an all girls middle/high school and our brother went to the local public high school where our dad was a guidance counselor.   <br> All of us went to college and moved out of Rhode Island to jobs in our careers.  I live in Connecticut, my sister lives in South Carolina  and my brother lives in Connecticut. We all have families and see one another around the holidays.
