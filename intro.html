<h1> Early Years </h1>
<p>I was born in Providence, Rhode Island as the eldest of three children. My mother and father bought a house in Pawtucket, R.I.. My sister and brother are four and nine years younger than me, respectively. We had a cocker spaniel named Buffie who lived to be nineteen years old!</p> 
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I went to a Montessori school until 5th grade then to an all girls catholic K-12 school. I obtained a B.S. in chemistry at Providence College, Providence, RI. I then went to medical school at Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University in Philadelphia, PA and obtained a doctorate in pharmacology.  Now, I am finishing my Master’s of Science degree in Education at Quinnipiac University (QU) and this is my last summer at QU.  I am enrolled at Temple University Fall 2023-25 in School of Education to learn to teach medical students the subject of pharmacology in the Professional Health Education program. </p>
<h3>Work Experience</h3>
<p>As a bench scientist, and a pharmacologist, I worked at National Eye Institute in Bethesda, Maryland in Proteomics. Also, I  was a bench scientist at the US Army Medical Institute of Chemical Defense at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Edgewood, Maryland in the neuropharmacology and neurotoxicology labs on scientific teams. Now, in my future, I am going to teach (face-face, online, and hybrid) pharmacology in a health sciences or medical school after I finish my master’s degree at Temple University in 2025. </p>
<h4>Family Life</h4>
<p>I am a single mother residing in Connecticut and have two adult children who are in college in CT.  I love to go to the gym, read, volunteer at my local church, play sports, spend time outside, and am a third order Lay person in the Order of Preachers in the Catholic Church.</p>
<h5>Instructional Design and Technology(IDN) Career</h5> 
<p>I have enjoyed learning IDN and new technology skills. I look forward to collaborating with all of you this summer in web design. I am happy I am learning how to do this class in coding because I do not know computer science but as a life long learner, I am excited to be here and learn from all of you!</p>
