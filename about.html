<h4>Dementia: Symptoms?</h4>
<p>Signs of dementia in daily life are short term memory loss, reasoning, or thinking.  Symptoms of dementia in one's day are: short 
term memory problems traveling, remembering appointments, planning activities in the day, paying bills, keeping track of things of 
where you put them, or organizing them. 
Many conditions are progressive, which means that the signs of dementia start out slowly,and gradually get worse.</p>

<h5>Get help</h5>
<p>If you or someone you know is experiencing memory difficulties or other changes in thinking skills,
don't ignore them. See your doctor, a geriatric physician and a neurologist, soon to determine the cause. Professional evaluation may detect a treatable condition. If
the symptoms suggest dementia, early diagnosis allows a person to get the maximum benefit from available treatments and provides
an opportunity to volunteer for clinical trials or studies.</p>
