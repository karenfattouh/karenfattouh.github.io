<p>If you or someone you know is experiencing memory difficulties or other changes in thinking skills,
don't ignore them. See your doctor, a geriatric physician and a neurologist, soon to determine the cause. Professional evaluation may detect a treatable condition. If
the symptoms suggest dementia, early diagnosis allows a person to get the maximum benefit from available treatments and provides
an opportunity to volunteer for clinical trials or studies.</p>
